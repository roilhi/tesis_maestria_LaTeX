@article{Klofas2012,
abstract = {This paper explores the evolution of CubeSat communications, starting with the first Cube- Sat launch in 2003 and ending with the latest ELaNa-6 launch from Vandenberg AFB on 13 September 2012. The communication systems for the first few CubeSats were based on COTS amateur radio gear, which worked extremely well but had very limited data rates. With the maturation of CubeSats from beep-sats to high-performance satellites with science or military missions, cheap, high-bandwidth communication systems are being developed. This paper aims to document these new high-bandwidth systems.},
